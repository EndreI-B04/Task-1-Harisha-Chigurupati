          <li>Add a paper filter to the coffee maker.</li>
          <li>
            Slightly wet the filter, this removes the paper taste from the
            coffee.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add water and coffee to the coffee maker, 60 grams or 6 coffee
            spoons per litre.
          </li>
          <li>Shake the filter so the coffee spreads evenly.</li>
          <li>

        <h2>Types of coffee beans</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Arabica</dt>
          <dd>
            The most popular type of coffee, hands down. Depending on who you
            ask, many coffee enthusiasts prefer using Arabica beans due to its
            taste. Typically used for black coffee.
          </dd>
          <dt>Robusta</dt>
          <dd>
            While Arabica is the most popular, Robusta is a cheaper and stronger
            type of coffee bean. Because of its bitter flavor, you'll typically
            see Robusta used for espresso drinks and in instant coffee mixes.
          </dd>
          <dt>Excelsa or Liberica</dt>
          <dd>
            Excelsa or coffea liberica accounts for less than 1.5% of commercial
            coffee grown. Liberica coffee beans are much larger than the more
            popular arabica and robusta beans. Due to its rarity and limited
            supply on a global level, the cost of regular liberica beans is on
            the higher end.
